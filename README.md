The user will be initially prompted to either view/create recipes or search nutritional facts. When a user clicks on the nutritional facts they will be able to search any food they are wanting to find information on and append a list of nutritional facts about the food. This information is found using our API from Edamam.

If the user selects the recipe they will be given the opportunity to either add there own recipe to the database or view already posted recipes on the application database. This database was made using MySQL.
